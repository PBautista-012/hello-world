I love...
Playing drums
Collecting shoes (Nike brand of shoes)
Travelling (with my family and my special "someONE")
Programming and exploring things using my laptop and the internet
Photography (during special occassion)
Collecting pictures of cars (maybe my dream car)
Playing basketball
Swimming or outing with my family
Eating "fatty foods" (pizza, fries, carbonara, fried/grilled chicken, steak, ice cream/snow cone, many more...)
Watching movies (comedy, romantic, adventure)
Listening to music (rnb, rock, drum solo)
and most of all.. SLEEPING
